## Description

This smart contract code is written in solidity using Remix. It is used to create digital twins on-chain.

## Instructions

It can be run on the Remix IDE by using the Ethereum addresses of the participants readily available in the constructor of the smart contract. Each function has a state. The functions are placed in order in the code to make it easy to follow, test and run the code. More details on the code and the paper can be found in the published paper.
